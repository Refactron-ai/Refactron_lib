Issues/File:        45.88
Issues/1K lines:    286.72
Analysis Time:      0.25s
```

**Issue Breakdown:**
- Type Hints: 130 (35%) - Missing annotations

### 5. Test Suite

**Quality Score: B** (Tests have different standards)

```
Files:              6
Lines:              1,460
Issues:             393
Critical:           0 ✅
Issues/File:        65.50
Issues/1K lines:    269.18
Analysis Time:      0.38s
```

**Issue Breakdown:**
- Security: 169 (43%) - Test code uses eval() intentionally
- Maintainability: 132 (34%) - Test functions are long
- Type Hints: 76 (19%)
- Code Smells: 11 (3%)
- Style: 5 (1%)

**Key Insights:**
- ✅ No actual security issues (the "dangerous" functions are in test data)
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage
- 🟡 High issue count is typical for test files
- 🟡 Test functions tend to be longer and more complex

**Note:**
Test code naturally has higher issue counts because:
1. Tests intentionally create "bad" code to test detection
2. Test functions are often long (arrange, act, assert)
3. Type hints are less critical in tests
4. Tests may use patterns that would be anti-patterns in production
