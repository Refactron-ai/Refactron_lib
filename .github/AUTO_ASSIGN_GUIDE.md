## 🚀 **How to Use**

### **Step 1: Find an Issue**
- Browse issues: https://github.com/Refactron-ai/Refactron_lib/issues
- Look for issues labeled `good-first-issue` or `help-wanted`

### **Step 2: Claim the Issue**
- Comment on the issue: `/assign`
- The bot will assign the issue to you
- You'll get a confirmation message

### **Step 3: Work on the Issue**
- Fork the repository
- Create a branch for your changes
- Make your changes
- Submit a pull request

### **Step 4: Reference the Issue**
- In your PR description, mention: `Fixes #123` or `Closes #123`
- This will automatically link your PR to the issue

## 📝 **Example Workflow**

```
👤 User: "I'd like to work on this issue!"
🤖 Bot: "Comment /assign to claim this issue"

👤 User: "/assign"
🤖 Bot: "✅ Successfully Assigned! This issue has been assigned to @username"

👤 User: [works on the issue, creates PR]
👤 User: "/unassign" (if they can't continue)
🤖 Bot: "✅ Assignment Removed. The issue is now available for others!"
```

## ⚠️ **Important Rules**

### **One Person Per Issue**
- ✅ Only **one person** can be assigned to an issue at a time
- ❌ If someone else is already assigned, you'll get an error message
- ✅ You can still comment and collaborate without being assigned

### **Self-Assignment Only**
- ✅ You can only assign **yourself** to issues
- ❌ You cannot assign other people
- ✅ This prevents spam and ensures genuine interest

### **Assignment Removal**
- ✅ You can unassign yourself anytime with `/unassign`
- ✅ This makes the issue available for others
- ✅ Use this if you can no longer work on the issue
